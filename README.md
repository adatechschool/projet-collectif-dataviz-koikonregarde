# projet-collectif-dataviz-koikonregarde

Collective project made during ADA Tech School, aimed to learn the uses of API in the context of a website with the classic HTML/CSS/JS components.

The idea was to create a find-your-movie website using TMDB API for creating a random choice of a movie, with all the informations about it delivered.
